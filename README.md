- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jukie-1
- 👀 I’m interested in Video Game Development and hardware (Almost anything that uses electricty as a medium, well things that are more complex then a lightbulb, a toaster or a microwave, are my jam)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity Modding, c#, a very small amount of java (its not one of my top Priorities)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity games, Unity modding, and video game modding in general
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: I honestly don't care, As a kid i was mistakin for a girl a lot of times so it doesn't matter (tbh i do wish i was a girl, people expect way to much from a man)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have hacked a few of my own computers because i forgot the passwords to them... I mean older computers were pretty easy to hack, I know some computers like they are a part of me.
